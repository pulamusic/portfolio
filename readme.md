## An Instructional Design Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio I am constructing in order to market my skills as an instructional designer. The site has been created using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. The layout of the site was adapted from the [Creative Portfolio Theme](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme) produced by [Kishan B](https://kishaningithub.github.io/).

##### Notes to Self

Figure out how I'm supposed to link the `static/custom.css` file to the header of the theme. It's not clear in the theme's documentation.
* [This article](https://mattmayes.com/posts/2019/hugo-add-custom-css-properly/) might help.

Is there a way to use Google Fonts with this site?

Check out [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/), the Markdown handler for Hugo.

I've enabled the use of emoticons(see `config.toml`). Here is a link to an [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

Once I have deployed the site, register it with Disqus in order to get a shortname for the site. Add the shortname to the `config.toml` file.

Also register the site with Google Analytics. Add the tracking code to `config.toml`.
